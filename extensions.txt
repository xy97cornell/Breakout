Used Soundcloud for We are the Champions music and Wah Wah sound.

The extensions we added are: levels, when a player wins a level, they can go on
to the next level were an extra row of bricks are added. 
If they lose, they go
back to the first level. We added sound when the ball hits the paddle, and we
added sounds when the ball hits a brick. 
The sound when the ball hits the brick
is random (the game randomly plays one of a few different sounds). 
There is also
sound played when a player loses a level (wah wah) and wins a level (we are the
champions). 
Furthermore, we added a multitude of different messages, such as 
current level, current score (score of the current level), amount of lives, and 

total score (score throughout all levels combined). 
We also added a powerup:
extra lives. The player receives an extra life when the player destroys half 
the bricks of a certain level 
(if odd number of bricks in a level, then 0.5 more
 than half) and when the player destroys all of the bricks in a level. 
A message
"extra life" flashes on the screen when the player gets an extra life. These 
extra lives carry through the levels. 
We also added some special effects to 
some of the messages, such as the "3 2 1" countdown message and the end message where the messages pop out. 
We also made the
ball to be an image of Professor Walker White's head. Furthermore, we added
special physics to the ball, 
so that depending where the ball hits the paddle,
the ball's direction and speed change. 
For example, hits in the center goes 
straight up, hits far to the left, goes very low and very fast to the left,
same for the right, and etc. 
Basically, the ball's speed is multiplied by a
 constant that depends where the on the paddle the ball hit.
